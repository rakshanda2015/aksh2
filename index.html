        <p>Cricket can be played for competition or for fun. Cricket is a good sport for developing overall fitness, stamina and hand–eye coordination.<br/><br />Whenever I come to home from school, After completing my homework I always play cricket with my friends at 5:30 pm.Cricket develops nine of the ten Fundamental Movement Skills, more than any other sport.They are running, jumping, throwing, catching, batting, bowling, agility, balance and coordination.

        <h1>Virat Kohli</h1>
        <p>Virat Kohli is one of the finest fielder in not just only the current Indian team but also considering the present cricketer all over the world. He is very quick on the field , has a strong throwing arm and a more than decent catcher which makes him a brilliant fielder outside the circle. Over the years, he has yearned and yearned a lot over his fitness so that, when he dives while taking a catch or saving the ball going to boundary, it shouldn't cause any injury. Especially, in last 2 years or so, there's hardly any match (of course for the exceptions of likes of ABs) as far as athleticism is concerned.</p>

        <h1>Ms Dhoni</h1>
        <p> if you view Dhoni as a genuine cricket fan, you would see that there is a lot to learn from him and the young cricketers can always get the best tips from him. For instance, even when he is not that good in batting these days, he is India’s best finisher and has won several matches for the team single-handedly. Besides, he has over 10,000 ODI runs which is not a bad record at all.

And he is surely a school for the young wicket-keepers who are looking to get in the national team. As a wicket-keeper, he has established himself among the best in the world, in spite of making a debut too late in the team. He has the record of the fastest stumpings and he also has the natural gift of being too accurate in taking DRS calls. And not to forget, he has all the major ICC trophies, which is still a dream for even the best captains in the world. I know that he had bad sides when he removed the experienced players from the team and he never really cared about people like Gautam Gambhir. However, it is important to learn the good and overlook the bad side. A good teacher is still a human being and human beings can make mistakes.</p>
